1. Use 5 datasets found on https://snap.stanford.edu/
<br /> Undirected: Reddit Hyperlink Network https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html Body & title dataset are both considered.
<br />            Twitch Gamers Social Network https://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitch_gamers.html
<br /> Directed:  Wikipedia Talk network https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-Talk.html
<br />           California road network https://snap.stanford.edu/data/roadNet-CA.html   
2. As indicated in the type of dataset we would use we apply the algorithm on both directed and undirected graphs.
3. Add another heuristic metric as another contribution.
4. If we can finish all the above in the week there might be something more.
